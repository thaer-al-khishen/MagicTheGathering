# MagicTheGathering
Magic The Gathering app made with Kotlin, integrating Rxjava and Dagger Hilt

This is my attempt at using the MagicTheGathering api to demonstrate the latest practices in android development.

This app includes:

1- RxJava, a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.

2- Dagger Hilt, the latest trend in dependency injection.

3- Databinding with adapters.

4- A nested recyclerview in which a nested JSON arraylist is parsed. This is observed when you click on the view all button from the home fragment.

You'll get a vertical recyclerview with each item having a gridrecyclerview containing dates.
